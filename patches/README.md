# Local patches to submodules

Applied on top of `ext/PS2Recomp` (upstream ran-j/PS2Recomp @ 75d729c). Re-apply after a fresh clone with:

    git -C ext/PS2Recomp apply ../../patches/ps2recomp/*.patch

- `0001-recomp-resume-points-for-standalone-entry-blocks.patch` — the recompiler skipped resume-point registration
  for every `entry_*` function, assuming they are synthetic wrappers nested in a real function. Ghidra's export names
  65k standalone code blocks `entry_*`, so a thread switched out inside a call from one (e.g. static constructor
  `entry_004186f0`, resume at 0x418724) could never be resumed. Now only `entry_*` blocks nested inside a real
  function are skipped (sorted interval lookup).
- `0002-runtime-headless-mode.patch` — `PS2X_HEADLESS=1` runs without a window or audio device (automated runs,
  locked host session). `PS2X_HEADLESS_SHOTS=<dir>` saves the presented frame to PNG every
  `PS2X_HEADLESS_INTERVAL` seconds with a heartbeat line on stderr; `PS2X_HEADLESS_SECONDS` bounds the run.
- `0003-iop-cdvd-image-search-and-trayreq.patch` — with a disc image configured, the IOP cdvdman emulation read sectors
  from the image but resolved `sceCdSearchFile` against a virtual layout built from the host folder (different LSNs),
  so IOP-side file reads (Killzone's PFILE_R.IRX streamer) could land on the wrong sectors. Search now walks the image's
  own ISO9660 directory. Adds `sceCdTrayReq` (cdvdman #14; tray never moves), called ~2.7k times per boot.
